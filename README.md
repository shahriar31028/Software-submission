# Software-submission

Our project name is QuickFood. Here we can login as a restaurant manager and as a normal user.
In both cases, we can order food from our desired restaurant.
If anyone login as a restaurant manager, he can create a restaurant and add food item to the list.
Then the user can order the food and the order list will appear.
We can also see if the order is prepared or cancelled or on the way from the app as the restaurant manager will change that.
